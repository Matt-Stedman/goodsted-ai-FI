		"problem" : "There is a play crisis. Children across the world are being deprived from their right to the learning, interactions and pleasure produced through outdoor play. Globally children lack access to creative and inclusive outdoor play areas. In low income communities the lack of investment in play areas and prioritisation of child's play, further amplifies the failure to meet this basic human right. As a result children's development, resilience and creativity is stunted. Playgrounds are too stagnant in design, too complicated to install and too costly to maintain. We need resilient, accessible, engaging play areas that children want to use and that communities want to invest in. \n",
		"need" : "Currently we need support in generating inbound sales. All our current sales have been outbound and generated through networking leads. Currently due to the size of the organisation, I am not able to commit as much time to outbound sales as i would like to. I previously worked with a university to generate a marketing strategy but have found it challenging to implement due to time constraints.\n\nTo generate a marketing and sales strategy for inbound sales that requires only 20% of my time. To generate a practical digital marketing strategy to generate leads from our customer segments (schools, local municipalities and STEM based businesses) .\n",
		"about" : "",
		"plan" : "We have some ideas about how we can run this as a workshop to tackle our challenge, however we are flexible to see what you would suggest as professionals volunteering to help. We think we can have 3 teams, and have 3 professionals in each team. \n\nTeam 1 can help determine 2 customers within the business and school customer segments that Dream Networks should focus sales effort on and generate sales and marketing strategy to drive sales to these customers. I can come with suggested customers. The teams can ask me questions about them to generate personas etc for the strategy) \n\nTeam 2 and 3 can focus on creating inbound sales strategy for the 2 main customer groups (schools and businesses). Each team can focus on one segment, create persona, brainstorm strategies and create an action plan document for me to move forward with. The most important part is I can only give 20% of my time to implement these strategies.\n\nWe can update the plan for how to tackle this challenge after having our supporters. As the sales professionals supporting us will be experts on this subject we would like to hear your thoughts!",
		"why" : "We are collaborating with businesses, schools and communities to co-design creative and sustainable play area that are tailored to the needs of the communities they serve. Through our interactive educational co-design programme children are empowered to co-design engaging play areas that are sustainably built locally. Our play areas are currently implemented in spaces in schools and communities in the UK and Africa. We use digital tools to enable users to engage in the co-design process and collaboratively design solutions. We have big dreams, we want to collaboratively create affordable, accessible and co-designed child play areas for all.\n",

		"need" : "Maintaining Physical and Mental Wellbeing is key especially during these unprecedented times. Facilitating virtual tea times (30 minutes to 1 hour sessions) will help people find mindfulness and also allow exchange of wellbeing strategies. We want to bring CommuniTEAs together and form support groups where people can share meaningful conversations and motivational stories.",
		"about" : "",
		"plan" : "",
		"why" : "A proud London-based social enterprise supporting wellbeing, mindfulness, and sustainability initiatives, HumaniTea produces the UK’s 1st chilled ready-to-drink Plant-based Tea Lattes brewed with actual tea leaves, creamy oat milk, and Fairtrade, organic ingredients. Our 100% natural Vegan Tea Lattes, available in Matcha, Earl Grey, and Rooibos flavours, contain low sugar and calories, exclude preservatives, artificial flavours, and any additives, and offer refreshing boost of calm energy without the coffee caffeine crash.\n\nDuring market research, I discovered that the NHS spends over £6 billion per year on obesity and overweight-related illnesses. The obesity problem is so huge that the UK government decided to take action and implemented a soft drinks industry levy, where companies pay a tax for having more than 5% sugar content in their soft drinks. I believe healthy living and drinking is key to a happy body and mind. So I decided to tackle the problem of obesity-causing sugary soft drinks with the creation of our delicious Vegan Tea Lattes – a healthier alternative to current iced tea beverages and coffee lattes on the market. Our tea lattes actually taste like tea unlike Lipton Iced Tea or Nestea for example.\n\nIn addition, one in six people in the UK suffer from mental health issues due to stress from work. Spreading “Me Time, Tea Time, Any Time”, we encourage people to enjoy tea breaks throughout the day and night. Just a five-minute tea break can really help one find mindfulness. Taking regular breaks from the hustle and bustle of work is key to maintaining physical and mental wellbeing.",

		"problem" : "My Pickle Creative Brief - Outreach campaign\n\n*Overview*\nMy Pickle is a not-for-profit organisation with a primary mission to help anyone in the UK facing a crisis to get the support they need, when they need it. My Pickle has recently adapted the look of the brand and is refreshing its website, mypickle.org, to provide a seamless user journey with an objective to start wider marketing outreach via social media and direct mail campaigns in September.\n\n*Initiative and USP*\nWith more individuals going online to source help for personal issues, the sheer number of websites to navigate via a google search can be overwhelming and result in a struggle to source the most effective results which aren’t misleading.\n\nAs an example, a Tech vs Abuse research study found that for those facing domestic abuse “Google searches can lead down ‘rabbit holes’ causing delays and worsening personal situations”. Another example through Citizens Advice, reported that of 3.3 million people needing free specialist money advice, 47% failed to access it because they simply did not know where to look.\n\nThis problem does not lie with individual’s looking for support alone. Friends and family, workplace organisations and even health workers themselves find the online search landscape complex to navigate. Additionally, for many organisations and smaller charities it can be challenging to be found in searches and online platforms.\n\nMy Pickle aims to change this by making it easy to find help fast and to discover support that would not otherwise be found with an approach which differs from it’s competitor navigation websites. Where other directory websites often focus on issue, location and typically direct to a hierarchy of partner organisations, My Pickle takes a grassroots approach, crowdsourcing listings, reviews and signposts nationally available services. Via the website a user can filter and browse to narrow results matching their individual needs.\n\n*Audience*\nThis brief will focus on a B2C audience identified as: \n\n - Individual Beneficiaries; Individuals in the UK that are facing personal issues and are interested in finding help.\n - Professional beneficiaries; Professional networks such as health and social care workers that wish to signpost clients or patients.\n\nAudience actions; the audience should respond to the deliverables of this creative brief:\n\nThink - Eye catching. What is My Pickle?\nFeel - Compelled to read further, interested in the clear concept\nDo - search ‘MyPickle.org’ and\/or tell at least one other person about the service\n\n*Deliverables*\nDeliverables for this brief are:\n\n - 1 x A4 Poster to be featured in 3000 GP’s and health centres nationwide (150gsm)\n - 1 x Business Card with double sided design to be used by street teams in community hubs including cafes, hairdressers, local shops as examples.\n\nPrior to resulting in the above final approved designed, we would like to see:\n - 3 x design options for each deliverable above.\n\nPlease note: A link to our Canva account and\/or shared drive will be provided in order to access relevant brand assets\n\n*Essentials and messaging*\nWhilst we are keen to see designs using fresh eyes and design expertise we would like the below essentials in the designs:\n\n - Logo and mascot\n - URL - clear and prominent\n - Key message; “Find help fast” with secondary tagline of ‘Whatever the problem, My Pickle will help you find support in the UK’.\n - Call out for ‘New support network’\n - People imagery. It would be useful to see options of people imagery vs no people imagery within the design options provided.\n - Due to some ongoing independent research we may have some headline statistics which would be valuable to add in lozenge format, if this could be factored into the designs with copy to be provided at a later stage.\n\n*Timing*\nInitial design options delivered - Monday 17th August\nFeedback and design amends 1st round - Thursday 20th - Tuesday 25th August\nDesign and amends 2nd round - Wednesday 26th - Friday 28th August\nFinal sign off - Wednesday 2nd September\nFinal artwork delivered to printers - Friday 4th September\n",

We will not ask about the contents of sessions or diagnoses. The interviews can be conducted remotely on Zoom or other suitable video platforms or telephone. If selected, you will be required for one, and in some cases, two interviews, lasting between 45 and 75 minutes. Co-opts will say ‘thank you for your time with a £20 Love to Shop voucher for each interview you are asked to take part in and please rest assured that the interview(s) will be completely confidential, any personal data anonymised and your data from the interview will not be shared outside the study.",

		"why" : "Introduction: Climate change is an increasingly urgent global issue, necessitating the acceleration of sustainable solutions and the transition to circular economies. The Africa and West Asia (AWA)) region faces unique climate challenges, including desertification, water scarcity, and food security concerns. In response, we have witnessed the emergence of numerous grassroots initiatives, startups, SMEs, and social businesses across the region working diligently to convert biowaste into valuable bioresources, such as compost and biofertilizers. By harnessing innovative business models and technologies, we aim to overcome sector barriers and create sustainable organic waste management and agricultural value chains. We believe it is crucial to establish a coalition of organic waste recyclers and biofertilizer producers that allows us to join forces.\nThis coalition will facilitate knowledge exchange, collaboration, and co-creation among its members, empowering us to more effectively address the region's pressing environmental challenges. By fostering a strong network of like-minded stakeholders, we aim to amplify our collective impact and drive the development of sustainable and circular economies in the AWA region.\n\nVision: The vision for this coalition is a world where organic waste is transformed into valuable resources for sustainable agriculture, and biofertilizers are widely adopted by farmers, contributing to increased productivity, soil health, and environmental protection.\n\nMission: The mission of the coalition is to promote cooperation and innovation among organic waste recyclers and biofertilizer producers in order to advance sustainable agriculture, reduce environmental impacts of food waste, and support the growth and development of both industries.",
